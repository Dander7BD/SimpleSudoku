# SimpleSudoku
A challenge for me issued by HiQ


"Programming assignment
Make a Sudoku generator that presents different arbitrary assignments in the size of 4*4. Spend 2-4 hours on the assignement. If the time is not enough it is OK. We will focus more on the code, rather than the result of the assignment. 

Example

Write in Java or JavaScript
Visualize the results in the way you find it easiest. Its Ok to do just a console printout if it is not your favorite area
Place the code on GitHub
Assignment time 2-4 hours.  

When the assignment is completed, we will together go through the code. 

Good Luck"

I already decided to use JavaFX as GUI

I'll clock my start at 2017-01-23 : 12.30
